List of Prerequisite skills/knowledge for the target audience

A summary description of the technology or skill being described
At least 5 sub sections
Intro
Part 1 (Often answers “why would I want to do this?”)
Part 2 (Often answers “how can I do this?”)
Part 3 (Often expands on how cool this is.)
Conclusion
Sections which are to include code should be flagged -- at least one section MUST include code examples.
In addition to the outline, a github repo must be prepared at this point to hold additional code samples. This repo does not have to be a complete project, but it does have to exist.

# Introduction:

For those of you that are familiar with CSS, you may be aware that CSS can be very repetitive. The extent to which code in CSS is repeated also increases the difficulty of its maintainability. The programmer must search through many lines of code in order to upkeep visual 'cleanliness' of not only the code itself, but also of the web pages to which the code represents.
